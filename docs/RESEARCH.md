## How 40Hz Stimulation Works

40Hz is in the gamma frequency range (30-100Hz) of brain oscillations. External sensory stimulation at this frequency entrains neural gamma rhythms, which triggers a cascade of beneficial effects:

1. **Interneurons** synchronize to the 40Hz rhythm
2. They release **VIP peptide** (vasoactive intestinal peptide)
3. VIP activates the **glymphatic system** (brain waste clearance)
4. Amyloid-beta is flushed from brain tissue into cerebrospinal fluid
5. **Microglia and astrocytes** increase their clearance activity

### Key Parameters (Wang et al. 2026 — Monkey Study)

- **Carrier tone**: 1 kHz pure tone
- **Modulation**: Pulsed at 40Hz (25ms on/off intervals)
- **Intensity**: ~65 dB SPL (normal conversation level)
- **Duration**: 1 hour/day for 7 days
- **Effect**: CSF Aβ42 increased ~206%, Aβ40 increased ~201%
- **Persistence**: Effects lasted 5+ weeks after stimulation ended

## Phase III Clinical Trial

Cognito Therapeutics (MIT spinoff) is running the **HOPE** trial — a nationwide Phase III study of 40Hz audiovisual stimulation for Alzheimer's. Fully enrolled as of early 2026.

## Other Frequencies

| Band | Range | Associated Effects |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Delta | 0.5-4 Hz | Deep sleep, memory consolidation |
| Theta | 4-8 Hz | Memory encoding, reduced anxiety (TBS is FDA-cleared for depression) |
| Alpha | 8-13 Hz | Relaxation, creativity, depression symptom relief |
| Beta | 13-30 Hz | Focus, alertness, studied for ADHD |
| Gamma | 30-100 Hz | Cognition, amyloid clearance, memory binding |

37.5Hz also showed memory improvements in a 100+ person Scottish study (Current Biology, 2023).
